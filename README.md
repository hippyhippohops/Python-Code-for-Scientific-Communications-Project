# Python-Code-for-Scientific-Communications-Project

In this study, we aimed to postulate whether using $N$ decks in a game of Blackjack affects the probability of winning for players. At the time of the project, current studies are limited at six decks which misrepresents the gambling scene where it is more common to use more than six decks. In this repository, I have added the code used to tha generates the required probability via numerical simulation, by requesting a user input for the number of decks.
